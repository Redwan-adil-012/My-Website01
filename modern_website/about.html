        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>My name is Radwan Ahmed Adil, and I come from Bangladesh. I am currently enrolled in the Web Design and Development course at Washington University of Science and Technology (WUST), which I am thoroughly enjoying.</p>
        <p>One of the best things about my life is that I can gain power and understanding from times of reflection. Reading has been very important for me as a way to focus on myself, have fun, grow as a person, and change the way I see life.</p>
        <p>I want to learn about both the technical and artistic sides of website design in this class so that I can make webpages that look good and work well. Over time, I want to get good enough at web development that I can lead creative online projects, work with driven teams, and follow instructions to provide useful digital solutions.</p>
        <p>Looking for new ideas, being creative, and using new tools to improve my skills are some of my favorite things to do outside of school.</p>
        <p>One interesting thing about me is that I can quickly adjust to new settings and find ideas in a lot of different places. I'm excited to start this journey and learn everything I need to know to shape my digital job path.</p>
        <p>Thank you!</p>
